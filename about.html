                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a dedicated and ambitious student from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), specializing in Information Technology. With a strong foundation in web technologies, I have honed my skills through numerous projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and Django. My passion for technology extends to the realms of Machine Learning, OpenCV, Data Analysis, and Natural Language Processing, where I have applied my knowledge to solve complex problems and derive meaningful insights.</p>
                <p>Proficient in various version control tools and integrated development environments (IDEs), I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience, allowing me to develop a robust technical skill set. Additionally, I have maintained a 75-day coding streak on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) in C++, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and coding proficiency.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I am equally passionate about developing my soft skills. Problem-solving, decision-making, and quick learning are at the core of my approach to tackling challenges. I pride myself on my leadership and creativity, which have been instrumental in my roles as Fest Curator for INCIDENT'24, Publicity Head for ENGINEER'23, and Chief Executive of the Kannada Vedike Club at NITK. These roles have provided me with invaluable experience in organizing events, leading teams, and fostering community engagement.</p>
                <p>I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and leadership abilities to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals. My goal is to continue growing in the field of Information Technology, making impactful contributions and driving positive change.</p>
